# botrac3r
### Yet another Discord bot
A Discord bot for utilities, fun, time zones, deleting spoo.py's lmaos, playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf, sending random hippos, and many more unrelated things.

## Running
### Install libraries
    npm install discord.io portscanner canvas exif sync-request
If you aren't able to install canvas, see https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas for help.
### Add token
Create an empty file named `token.txt` and put your bot token in it. There shouldn't be anything else in that file.

If you don't have a bot token, you should obtain one by creating an app at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me.
### Start bot
    node botrac3r.js

## Documentation
botrac3r's commands are documented in the `botrac3r-docs.pdf` and `botrac3r-docs.odt` files. The PDF is smaller but not editable; the ODT is larger and editable.
